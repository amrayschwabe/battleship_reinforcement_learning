# Coding Challenge
This repository contains a gym one player implementation of the classic boardgame Battleships and is intended to serve as a coding challenge for the seminar in deep reinforcement learning at ETH Zurich. The goal is to write a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that maximizes the given reward for destroying the battleships as fast as possible.
